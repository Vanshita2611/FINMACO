Gathering Financial Market Insights

Objective: 

Comprehensive stock market analysis and prediction using LSTM models.

Components:

• Calculate daily price changes.

• Use moving averages for trend identification.

• Assess daily return as a percentage change. 

• Determine the correlation between different stock closing prices. 

• Evaluate risk with Value at Risk (VaR).

• Train LSTM models for predicting future stock prices.

• Asset Allocation and Portfolio Optimization

• Safe Withdrawal Rate prediction to sustain your portfolio value over a longer period.

This model can play a pivotal role in strategy making. 

Uniqueness:
• Nobody tells you once you start saving, how much you can withdraw so that your portfolio remains unfazed over the years...
• This is where our model comes into the picture and we will tell you what and how much to withdraw
• Integration of LSTM models for accurate predictions and integrating data pipeline for real-time

insights: 

• Holistic approach covering historical and predictive elements.

• Practical insights for investors, emphasizing risk management.

• Communication: Transparently communicate findings with data visualizations.

• Outcome: Actionable insights and predictions for informed decision-making
